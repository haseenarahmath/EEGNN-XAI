# Unlocking Interpretability: XAI Strategies for Enhanced Insight in GNN-Based Hyperspectral Image Classification
DOI: [IEEE Xplore 10781678](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10781678)

### Overview
Hyperspectral image classification has achieved remarkable accuracy with **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**, yet their complexity obscures the reasoning behind predictions.  
This project integrates **Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)** techniques into **HyperGCN** to interpret model behavior.

Implemented explainers:
- **Saliency Maps** – gradient-based spectral importance visualization  
- **Integrated Gradients** – cumulative feature attribution  
- **Grad-CAM / Grad-CAM++** – spatial attention and class-wise heatmaps  

All experiments are conducted on the **Indian Pines** dataset using **PyTorch & Captum**, revealing key spectral bands and spatial patterns that drive classification.
